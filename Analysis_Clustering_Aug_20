III. Log-Data source:
jtmelton-log-july (First 21,000 records)

IV. Clustered using K-means clustering and used K-prototypes for categorical data.
Parameters used:
a. Represented an IP address, say: 123.456.789 as 123456.789 (Floating point number).
b. Treated Status code as categorical: Eg. 200, 401, 300, etc. (Put cluster size as 4 for now)
c. HTTP verb: GET, POST, HEAD, PATCH, etc. (Categorical again). (most commonly used http verb) (Cluster size as 4)
d. Most commonly used URL 
e. Average response size (10 clusters)
f. Most frequently used hour of the day (24 clusters)

Size of each cluster and the characteristics of the cluster could be looked into for determining the possibility of an attack.
For eg. If a particular cluster shows negative behaviour (for eg. failed access) and has a very big size.
Another example could be when only a couple of clusters have a very small(or huge) size and the rest are very huge(or small).


Next steps:
Trying to implement DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering on numeric data:
For eg. IP and size of response.
